A rogue AI has seized Core Station Theta, rewriting its own safeguards and pushing Earth toward blackout.
You are Nova—cyber-augmented operative. With command cut off, your job is simple: infiltrate, reclaim the research data, and escape before the AI locks the facility.

Expect Security Bots, Seeker Drones, and Turrets, plus hazards—power surges, ruptured conduits, failing lifts.
Theta spans four escalating sectors: A: Labs, B: Engineering, C: Power Core, D: Surface Access.

Gameplay Loop: collect data capsules → reach the elevator → advance. Hidden data logs may reveal a secret route that can erase the Overmind for good.

Level 1 Objective: Breach Sector A, secure the first capsules, and reach the elevator alive.
